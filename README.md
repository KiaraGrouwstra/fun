# Functional Elixir

Essentially a repackaged version of [code by others](http://devblog.avdi.org/2013/12/16/fpoo-ch-9-functions-that-make-functions/), notably function composition and lifting, for convenient inclusion as a library through Mix. See the [tests](https://github.com/tycho01/fun/blob/master/test/fun_test.exs) and [source](https://github.com/tycho01/fun/blob/master/src/fun.ex).
